## Customization

- Modify the `categorize_contact` method in `export_telegram_contacts.py` to change categorization logic
- Add more fields to export by modifying the headers and row data
- Adjust logging level in the script if needed

## Troubleshooting

- Check `telegram_export.log` for detailed error messages
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Google Sheets API credentials and permissions
- Make sure the Google Sheet exists and is shared with the service account

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or `credentials.json` to version control
- Keep your API credentials secure
- Regularly rotate your API credentials if possible

## Testing with a Few Contacts (Recommended)

**Telegram enforces rate limits when fetching full profile information for many contacts.**
To avoid long waits or being temporarily blocked, you can test the exporter with just a few contacts first:

1. Open `export_telegram_contacts.py` in a text editor.
2. Find the line:
   ```python
   for user in contacts.users:
   ```
3. Change it to process only the first 10 contacts:
   ```python
   for user in contacts.users[:10]:
   ```
4. Run the script and check your Google Sheet.
5. Once you confirm it works, change the line back to process all contacts:
   ```python
   for user in contacts.users:
   ```

**Note:**
- Exporting all contacts may take a long time and you may see messages about "flood wait" or sleeping. This is normal and is due to Telegram's rate limits.
- Be patient, or run the script in batches if you have many contacts.
