# Telegram Contacts Exporter

## üêç Install Python (Required)

If you do not already have Python 3.8 or newer installed, follow these steps:

1. Go to the official Python download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click the yellow "Download Python" button (the latest version is recommended).
3. Run the downloaded installer.
4. **Important:** On the first screen, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
5. Complete the installation.
6. To verify Python is installed, open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.10.0` or higher.

Now you are ready to continue with the Quick Start below!

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/micahdominguez/tg-contacts-exporter.git
cd tg-contacts-exporter
```

**Run the setup script:**

- **Windows:**  
  Double-click `setup.bat` or run:
  ```bash
  setup.bat
  ```

- **Mac/Linux:**  
  Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  bash setup.sh
  ```

**Follow the on-screen instructions:**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Telegram and Google credentials.
2. Download your Google `credentials.json` and place it in this folder.
3. Create a Google Sheet named `Telegram Contacts` and share it with your service account email.
4. **Important:** Activate the Google Drive API for your Google Cloud project at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Testing with a Few Contacts (Recommended)

**Note:** Running the script for all contacts may take a few minutes (or longer if you have many contacts), due to Telegram's rate limits. It's a good idea to test with just 10 contacts first:

1. Open `export_telegram_contacts.py` in a text editor.
2. Find the line:
   ```python
   for user in contacts.users:
   ```
3. Change it to process only the first 10 contacts:
   ```python
   for user in contacts.users[:10]:
   ```
4. Run the script and check your Google Sheet.
5. Once you confirm it works, change the line back to process all contacts:
   ```python
   for user in contacts.users:
   ```

5. Run the exporter:
   ```bash
   python export_telegram_contacts.py
   ```

**Check your Google Sheet for your exported contacts!**
